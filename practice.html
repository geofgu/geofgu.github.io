Finally, I realize that it’s unrealistic to memorize all the vocabularies before start writing. A more practical approach would be to learn how to write during writing. So first thing first, I must start writing right away and write as much as I can. Nonetheless, massive reading is also necessary, because it provide me with materials, without which there would be nothing to write about. Read a lot and collect the words and sentences of beautiful expressions and use them in my own articles. And the last thing to do is repeat, <b>enjoyably</b> hopefully.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<p>
Dear General Manager,
</p>

<p>
As a staff of Sales Department, I'm very glad to see the rapid development of our hotel. With the coming of New Year, I am writing to you to present my suggestion on the further improvement of our hotel—to establish a website of our own to attract more clients.
</p>

<p>
Firstly, with the development of Internet, more and more people are willing to go to the outside world through the information on Internet. Thus if we could establish our own website and introduce ourselves on it, more friends, especially foreign friends, could know our latest promotion at home whenever they want. Secondly, according to the statistics of World Hotel Association, 33% of clients made hotel reservation through the Internet last year. And the proportion will largely increase in year 2000. Thus if we could introduce reservation system on our homepage, clients could contact us and make reservation directly. Finally, hotel promotion on Internet could reduce our operation cost greatly.
</p>

<p>
As someone says that Internet shorten the distance of the world, I believe that the one who could make use of Internet effectively today will be the winner tomorrow. We will get a lot and have a brilliant future.
</p>

<p>
Yours sincerely,
&#x2026;

Dear Manager，
</p>

<p>
I am a reporter from the News Weekend. Because of the demand of my work, I often come to Beijing to do interviews. Your hotel is my favorite, because of the comfortable living conditions, and the considerate service, especially your excellent food.
</p>

<p>
The restaurants in your hotel have many kinds of delicious food such as Chinese food, Japanese food, French food and so on. Among these delicious foods, I like the Beijing Toast Duck best, not only because of its Chinese characteristics but also its special taste for people from all over the world. So every time I come here I always choose this course.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, what impressed me most is the high quality service, it always makes me feel at home. Waiters and waitresses are so kind and warmhearted that they always earnestly recommend every new or special food of the restaurant. I will recommend your hotel and restaurant to my friends without any reservation and hesitation.
</p>

<p>
Hope your hotel and restaurant will be more prosperous in the future.
</p>

<p>
Faithfully yours,
&#x2026;

<p>
Dear professor Moss，
</p>

<p>
I am Sandy Lee, an undergraduate student of the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. At the beginning of this semester, I registered one of your courses, African Literature and Culture. It is a two-hour course held on every Thursday afternoon. Yesterday, I received a notice from my department that a major course, Computer Principle, would be changed to Thursday afternoon. This major course conspicuously influences my credits and it is every important to me. Unfortunately, I can not study your course this semester.
</p>

<p>
Because of your reputation and my enthusiasm in literature, I hope I could study this course in next semester. I also heard that another course of yours, China Literature, is held every Friday afternoon. If the registration of this course hasn’t closed yet, I will be so glad to participate in your class.
</p>

<p>
Sorry to bother you, your help will be greatly appreciated.
</p>

<p>
Sincerely yours,
Sandy Lee

<h3 id="sec-2-4"><span class="section-number-3">2.4</span> The one who do not know how to use computer become more and more disadvantageous. Show the disadvantages and what action should government take?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-4">
<p>
Computer plays such an important role nowadays that it undeniably becomes the biggest concern of the present-day world as a whole. With the steady growth in the hi-tech, as well as computer, there is a growing tendency that man who does not know how to use the computer will become an illiterate. As far as I am concerned, there are several major disadvantages for these people.
</p>

<p>
In the first place, without computer's help, someone may waste a large amount of precious time to pay attention to complex calculation. It is believed that computer can do almost everything. It was gradually used not only in mathematics, physics, chemistry and astronomy, but in places like library hospital and military army to replace the works of man. Besides, a computer works much faster and more accurately than man. Therefore, one who cannot use the computer always fails to keep up with the development of modern society.
</p>

<p>
In addition, these kinds of people may lose opportunities that make new friends or contact with outside world and new technology. It is very clear that lots of changes have taken place in many aspects of people's lives because of the coming of the computer era. Multi-media and surfing on-line provide people with chances to learn more about the world and up-dated information. Moreover, sending E-mail seems to be the most convenient and efficient way to communicate with families, relatives and best friends. Unfortunately all above will never happen in the life of the layman.
</p>

<p>
In order to let everyone know about the computer skills, government should set forth solutions to eliminate the number of these kinds of illiterates. First and foremost, it is suggested to open more free related training classes, which can encourage people to cultivate the interesting of using computers. What's more, it is stylish to advertise the benefits to learn the computer.
</p>

<p>
All in all, the future for the computer is very promising. We hardly imagine what our world would be like without the computers.

<h3 id="sec-2-5"><span class="section-number-3">2.5</span> A balanced diet, or eating balanced meals, is the key to a healthy life. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement? Give reasons for your answer.</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-5">
<p>
Although a balanced diet is important, there are other factors which contribute to a healthy life. People in some cultures do not eat a balanced diet, but use limited food sources. In addition, lack of stress could well be as important as diet.
</p>

<p>
One culture-related reason concerns environmental or climatic conditions. The Inuit, in the Arctic Circle, live in harsh surroundings and their major source of food for many months of the year is fish. Nutritionists in industrialized countries would not consider their diet balanced or even healthy, yet Inuit people have flourished in food from the sea for centuries. Another cultural reason is religion-based. Many Hindus are vegetarians because of their religion. Again, many dieticians claim that vegetarianism is unbalanced because humans need protein, especially from animals. Hindus, however, seem to be quite healthy, suffering no ill effects from the lack of animal protein.
</p>

<p>
The major reason for disagreeing with the balanced diet argument, however, is to do with stress. Even though people in the past did not always have a balanced diet, something existing only on potatoes and bread, they lived healthy lives because there afflicts urban residents today. Secondly, there is a large percentage of contemporary people who do their jobs, then relax in front of the TV, and quite often eat junk food. But seem healthy enough. They may be spared disease by their relatively stress-free lives.
</p>

<p>
In conclusion, although it is undeniable that a balanced diet is of some importance to health, there are no doubt more factors that may get involved in affecting people’s health in terms of living environment, climate and stress in them.

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-6" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-6"><span class="section-number-3">2.6</span> The gap of living in cities and the countryside is larger and larger. What are the reasons in your country and how to reduce the differences?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-6">
<p>
As the step of economic development accelerates, the gap between the city and the countryside becomes more and more overt, which arouses colossal concerns. Take a further look at the phenomenon, there are three major causes.
</p>

<p>
Firstly, the insufficiency of investment in the rural areas accounts mainly for the issue. China, for example, covers a very large area. Due to the emphasis on the development in the coastal areas, the government devotes more investment in the large cities, such as Shanghai, Beijing and Guangzhou. The investment, undoubtedly, is repaid by the threefold increase of economy and commerce in these cities. However, this is not the case in the rural areas and the western regions. The lack of investment barriers the productivity and economic development and sharpens the gap between the city and the countryside.
</p>

<p>
Secondly, the low education level in the rural areas contributes partly to the gap of living. Education is the prime force of productivity. Keeping this in mind, many countries and governments give priority to the development of education. China’s education witnessed a rapid growth in the past decade. However, the education level in the countryside still keeps very low. The enrollment of primary schools and secondary schools is much lower compared with the advanced regions, not to mention the developed countries in the world. Without good education, the development of economy and technology would be a dream difficult to be realized.
</p>

<p>
Finally, the influx of migrant workers to the cities from the countryside deteriorates the undeveloped condition in the rural areas. The life style. in the urban areas is very attractive to the people in the countryside. To seek more working opportunities, many people abandon the fertile lands and leave them uncultivated. If the situation continues, it will lead to serious unbalance of economic and regional development.
</p>

<p>
To sum up, only when the government renders more concerns over the issue can the gap between the cities and the countryside be bridged.

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-7" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-7"><span class="section-number-3">2.7</span> Some people prefer to stay in the same job for the same company, but others prefer to change jobs frequently. You should use specific reasons to compare the advantages and disadvantages of both sides.</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-7">
<p>
Very few people intend to go in for a life-time career. Still there are some advantages to doing so.
</p>

<p>
Merits of always taking a position can be examined by three aspects. First, if you stick at taking a post, all angles of the job will have appeared; after some time, you will definitely have a good command of it. Consequently you may become a veteran of the field and earn respect or prestige from others. Second, you can establish an extensive social connections relating to the field, helping you tear down most of the barriers standing in the way of your working endeavor. Finally, mistakes of the routine tasks would be minimized because you have learned the lessons.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, I would like to illustrate the advantages of experiencing different jobs. Initially, we look at the issue of bribery. Many high-level staffs are inclined to accept bribes via power in hand. However, if he knows that someone else will soon take his place, such acts can be avoided. We then look at work motivation. If one works for the same company for a long time without promotion, he may get sick and tired of doing the same daily routine. Nonetheless, a manager should have qualities of a sense of teamwork and the capability of coordination. Therefore, to try various positions can help you gain ground to be promoted.
</p>

<p>
In summary, staying in the same post can cultivate one to cut out for the job but involve one in a boring career while changing jobs frequently can be both advantageous by keeping bribery away and providing one with more opportunities of promotion and disadvantageous by making mistakes occasionally. In my opinion, people should seek a decent and good-paid job and pay little attention to changing it.

In the past, mothers usually stayed with children when they were young. However, nowadays with more and more competition in society, mothers are deprived of most of the mothers’ rights. Therefore, kindergarten takes the job sharing mothers’ jobs. Someone believes that staying in kindergarten could be a wise choice for the present parents. However, the others doubt. I prefer to children’s studying in kindergarten. The reasons are as follows.
</p>

<p>
First of al, it’s obvious that kindergartens can offer children more systematic education than household teaching. The teachers have been well trained of children caring. The kindergarten provides not only good teaching facilities but friendly and harmonious studying environment where kids can play together and learn how to co-operate in a team.
</p>

<p>
Secondly, as children’s parents have to make a living, they probably have no choice but to work continually with no opportunity to study, which leads to no time spent on children caring. As a consequence, to leave children in kindergarten must be a mutual way for both parents and their children.
</p>

<p>
Last but not least, to reduce financial burden of the family, mother had better return to work as soon as possible for the cost of raising children and footing the bill of any consumption. That’s why so many young couples don’t choose to have children earlier. It is a fact every couple has to face and try figuring out the proper way to solve it.
</p>

<p>
In a word, I do support that young children should stay in kindergarten. And parents should return to work earlier. It is not only good for parents but children as well.

<h3 id="sec-2-9"><span class="section-number-3">2.9</span> Charity organizations should give aid to people in the greatest need, wherever they are from, or help people in their own countries. Discuss both views and give your opinion.</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-9">
<p>
Opponents of charity organizations only giving aid domestically, however, contend the assistance should be open to people in need no matter where they are from. To start with, it is the functionality of charity organizations to render help to those who are in great need, regardless of their nationalities. Otherwise, it may be considered as going breach of the purposes they are established for. What is more, not only can international charity assistance enhance the friendship of two nations, but also help eliminate the conflicts and misunderstandings, thereby stimulating the cultural exchanges between countries.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-10">
<p>
The reason that I oppose to the above view is the unfairness and inequality this proposal may conduce to. As is known to all, historic attractions are owned by all human beings and should be shared by people from all over the world equally and without discrimination. Once this proposal being implemented, an unfavorable impression of this country would be formed in no time. There is a fear that foreign travelers may never come again. Neither do their friends nor those who gain this negative information. And this will inevitably lead to a vicious circle. (95words)

A lot of innovations are made with the aim of making money for a few. This is because it is the rich and powerful people in our society who are able to impose 搜索changes (such as in working conditions or property developments) that are in their own interests. (第二句为解释论证)(《剑6》Test 4)My view is that young people should be encouraged to broaden their horizons. That is the best way for them to get a clear perspective of what they are hoping to do with their lives and why. (第二句为延伸论证) (《剑5》Test 2)To do this, we need to improve the choice of public transport services available to travelers. For example, if sufficient sky train and underground train systems were built and effectively maintained in our major cities, then traffic on the roads would be dramatically reduced.(第二句为举例论证)(《剑8》Test 3)The reasons for this trend may involve the recognition that a young adult who passes directly from school to university is rather restricted in terms of general knowledge and experience of the world. By contrast, those who have spent some time earning a living or traveling to other places, have a broader view of life and better personal resources to draw on. (第二句为对比论证)(《剑5》Test 2)

Well, I think it's definitely my bedroom. Since we don't have a study, we put our desk in the bedroom, and there is also a closet and a double bed, so it may feel a little cramped, but it's multi-functional and very cozy. I spend most of the time in my bedroom.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-1-5">
<p>
Yes, I think so, not only because they are still one of the main transports in China, but also because cycling is really a good form of exercise and it's eco-friendly too. I own a car, but I prefer to ride my bicycle to work as long as the weather permits.
</p>

<p>
In some way, cycling is more convenient and safer than driving if you consider the traffic jam, lack of parking places and car accidents. Also more economical for cars cost a lot in fuel, <b>maintenance</b> and parking fee.

Yes, I prefer car to bus or train because I think it's most comfortable. I can head out whenever I want, not limited by going to stations and wait as when I'm using public transport. And most importantly, I have privacy in my car, not have to sit with strangers, which really makes me feel restricted.

However, when I'm driving, I need to be attentive all the time, because there are so many reckless drivers out there and careless pedestrian coming out of nowhere.
