</li>
<li>They are <code>converging</code> here, we just wait for them.
</li>
<li>Regular bomb can't kill them, we can <code>rig a nuclear warhead with a shield timer</code>.
</li>
<li>The radiation <code>lures</code> MUTOs.
</li>
<li>We <code>detonate</code> the bomb in desert, with minimal <code>fallout risk to</code> the city.

<li>If the MUTOs have <code>spawned</code>, they will be building a nest.
</li>
<li>When you find the <code>warhead</code>, how long can you <code>disarm</code> it?
