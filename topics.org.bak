* PART 1
** Do you live in a house or a flat?
I live in a rented flat now, with my family.

** Have you ever considered moving to another place?
Yes. Actually we have bought a condo not far from my work, which is still under construction right now and will be available next summer. We call this a presale, it is very common in China. And now everyday we are all looking forward to moving to our new home next year.

** Which is your favourite room in your flat?
Well, I think it's definitely my bedroom. Since we don't have a study, we put our desk in the bedroom, and there is also a closet and a double bed, so it may feel a little cramped, but it's multi-functional and very cozy. I spend most of the time in my bedroom.

** Do you like your neighbours?
Not really I'm afraid. We barely know each other. At first it's really annoying that they often make an awful lot of noise. You see, the walls are not that thick as you may think. However, we've managed to ignore them now.

** Do you think bicycles will become more popular in the future?
Yes, I think so, not only because they are still one of the main transports in China, but also because cycling is really a good form of exercise and it's eco-friendly too. I own a car, but I prefer to ride my bicycle to work as long as the weather permits.

In some way, cycling is more convenient and safer than driving if you consider the traffic jam, lack of parking places and car accidents. Also more economical for cars cost a lot in fuel, *maintenance* and parking fee.

** Would you say it is difficult to learn to ride a bicycle?
No, not at all. I think it's rather fun and exciting. My dad taught me how to ride a bicycle and it's really funny that you know he was lying when he was holding your back and promised not to let it go.

** Have you ever traveled by train?
At least once a year. I always go back to my hometown by train to be with my parents on spring festivals. We like trains, it's like the Chinese have a thing for trains. China has an extensive railway network and a *variety* of trains, express, fast train, tourist train and now we have high-speed train which can reach up to 300 miles per hour. Really convenient and economical.

** Do you like traveling by car?
Yes, I prefer car to bus or train because I think it's most comfortable. I can head out whenever I want, not limited by going to stations and wait as when I'm using public transport. And most importantly, I have privacy in my car, not have to sit with strangers, which really makes me feel restricted.

However, when I'm driving, I need to be attentive all the time, because there are so many reckless drivers out there and careless pedestrian coming out of nowhere.
